.SYNOPSIS
    Integration tests for Test-Port function.

.DESCRIPTION
    Integration tests that verify Test-Port functionality against real network services
    and external hosts. Currently skipped until proper test infrastructure is established.

.NOTES
    These integration tests would validate real-world network scenarios including:
    - Testing against actual remote services
    - Network timeout handling
    - Real TCP/UDP service validation
    - Performance under load

    Tests are currently skipped pending test infrastructure setup.
